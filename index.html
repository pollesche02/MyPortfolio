      <p> My name is Danielle Pollesche. I love to work with people and enjoy a fun energized environment.
          I have worked in several different industries from Credit Card Services, Residential Real Estate,
          to Managing a Retail Business.
        <br> <br>
        The one common theme between my experiences are people, which is what I enjoy the most. With the right team and environment
          you can accomplish anything you set your mind to! I am trying to expand my technical expertise in 
          coding so I can bring a different perspective to what I do and apply different solutions.
          <br>
         At the end of the day it's all about having a great environment with good people!
          <br><br>
          I have experience with live current websites; as well as gaining experience with back and front end code 
          that will help me achieve your goals for your new website. I am currently in the process of gaining 
          my Certificate in Coding with JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, HTML, JSON, Node.js, and more from the University of Arizona. 
          I am known as one who can handle anything given to me and I have no problem communicating any issue or asking 
          clarification questions. With each new project I work towards making each experience the best one for everyone involved. 
          I am gaining more and more knowledge of the GitHub process that allows multiple developers the access to work together. 
          I am excited for the additional education I will get on future projects with other developers.
